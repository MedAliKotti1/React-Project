# React-Project
Hello Mr.Abderrahmen,

These are the updates and enhancements made so far for the project :

 1.I made an admin page (Backoffice),that you can access by pressing the 'Dingo Logo',
and typing in :

Username = "Validation-Project"
Password = "Crococoder_React"

By this you can access : Plates,AddPlate,Chefs and Users

2.I used PhoneInput in the AddChef and Signup , for inputing phone numbers .



I also want to thank you for all the advices and shared knowledge that you have given us so far ! 

Iâ€™m still trying to find ways to improve the code. Please keep me updated of any feedback you might have and thank you for your time and effort.

Best Regards,
Mohamed Ali Kotti.
